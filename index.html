The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is the world's dominant software platform.[1] It was originally a hypertext document management system[2] accessed over the Internet.[3]

The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server.</p>
